        thoughts: 
            food: food causes this
            shipQuality: ex: the enemy sees the ships are in bad quality and attacks.
            opinion of crew causes this. Zues is displeased but unlikely to react right now., etc.
            based on the recent chat we know the giant is hostile becaue you attacked him
        data:
            whatHappens: string to display to user on what happens
            isAlive: whether the user is still alive 
            crewStrength: what the new crew strength is (0-20)
            goldGain: the amout of gold/valuables they have gained
            shipQuality: the new ship quality after this encounter
            timeChange: the amount of time that has changed in days. If it's less than a day, should be 0.
            famousDeedsScore: the amount (1-5) that their heroic fame has increased. This is from stuff like killing monsters or meeting gods.
            toldFriendlyPeopleOfDeeds: weather or not they told friendly people about deeds. Put 0 if they told nobody or rank 1 (peasnant) to 5 (god) based on how important the person they boasted to was/how impressed they were.
            additionalDataToPassOn: if anything important happened that you want to keep track of, put it here. Perfectly okay to usually leave this blank. This will not be shown to the user but will be passed on to you in the next step
            peopleOfInterest: any new people of interest and their thoughts from [-10,10]. -10 means they want them dead, 10 means they are willing to help protect them. None of these people can actually kill, but this might influence future encounters (you piss off Poseidon so he makes a sea monster you're fighting more powerful)
